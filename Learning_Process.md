# Learning Process

## Question 1
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**  
It's a way to learn by explaining something in simple words, as if you're teaching it to a younger kid.

## Question 2
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

**Her Story**: Barbara Oakley told how she was bad at math and science growing up, but then she learned how to change her brain to get good at them later.

**Two Ways of Thinking**:
- **Focused Thinking**: This is when you're really concentrating, like doing homework. It's good for things you already know.
- **Diffuse Thinking**: This is when your brain is relaxed, like when you're playing or resting. It helps you get new ideas.

**Cool Tricks for New Ideas**:
- **Salvador Dalí's Keys**: A painter named Dalí would sit with keys in his hand. When he fell asleep, the keys would drop, waking him up, and he'd remember new ideas for his paintings.
- **Thomas Edison's Balls**: The inventor Edison did something similar with metal balls to get new ideas for his inventions.

**Beat Procrastination**: There's a trick called the **Pomodoro Technique**. You work for 25 minutes, then take a short break. This helps your brain focus and relax.

**Bad Traits Can Be Good**: Sometimes, things you think are weaknesses, like forgetting things easily, can actually help you be more creative!

## Question 3
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**
- **Focused Thinking**: This is when you're really paying attention, like when you're solving a math problem.
- **Diffuse Thinking**: This is when your brain is relaxed, like when you're daydreaming or taking a walk. It helps you find new solutions or ideas.

## Question 4
**According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**
- Break the skill into smaller parts.
- Learn just enough so you can start practicing and fix your own mistakes.
- Get rid of things that distract you when you're practicing.
- Practice for at least 20 hours.

## Question 5
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**
- **Work with 100% effort**: When you're working, give it your all! Don't get distracted.
- **Focus better**: Try to keep your mind on one thing for longer.
- **Separate work and play**: When it's time to work, work. When it's time to play, play.
- **Silence your phone**: Turn off notifications so they don't bother you.
- **Block social media**: Don't go on social media apps or websites when you should be studying.
- **Track your time**: Use an app to see how much time you spend on different tasks so you can get better.
- **Understand why it's used**: Figure out where a new idea or concept is actually used in the real world.
- **Explain it simply**: Can you explain the idea in your own simple words?
- **Try it yourself**: Can you use the idea in code or a project?
- **Don't rush**: Give yourself enough time to learn.
- **Be curious**: Ask questions and enjoy learning new things.
- **Make it yours**: Understand the idea in your own special way.
- **Teach others**: If you can teach it, you really know it!
- **Master a few things**: You don't have to be good at everything. Become really good at a few important things.
