# Tiny Habits - Reflection

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Question 1**  
What was the most interesting story or idea for you in the video?  
The best idea I liked was how doing small things can lead to big changes. BJ Fogg shared that he started by doing just two pushups after using the bathroom. Slowly, that turned into a workout habit. It made me feel like I can also start small and grow bigger by some time.

## 2. Tiny Habits - Core Message

**Question 2**  
How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What do M, A, and P stand for?  
B = MAP means that a habit creates when 3 things are there:  
- **M = Motivation**   
- **A = Ability**  
- **P = Prompt**   
If one of these is missing, it’s hard to do create habit. So we can make habits easier by keeping them simple and setting reminders.

**Question 3**  
Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?  
Because when we feel good after doing something, our brain wants to do it again. So if we smile, say "yes!" or do a happy move after a habit, it becomes more fun. Celebrating helps the habit stay in our mind.


## 3. 1% Better Every Day

**Question 4**  
What was the most interesting story or idea for you in the video?  
I liked the idea that getting just 1% better every day makes a big difference later. It taught me that I don’t need to change everything at once. Small steps every day can lead to big results in the future.


## 4. Atomic Habits - Book Summary

**Question 5**  
What is the book's perspective about identity?  
The book says that we should think about *who we want to become*, not just what we want to do. Like, instead of saying “I want to read,” say “I am a reader.” When we believe we are that kind of person, the habit becomes easy.

**Question 6**  
How does the book suggest making a habit easier to do?  
Make it simple and gather the resources. For example, if I want to drink more water, I can keep a water bottle near me. The easier it is, the more I will do it.

**Question 7**  
How does the book suggest making a habit harder to do?  
To stop a bad habit, make it harder. Like if I waste time on social media, I can delete the app or log out. Then I won’t open it so easily and after some days even I forget about it.


## 5. Reflection

**Question 8**  
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of.  
What steps can you take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive or easy, and the response satisfying?  
I will think of every time from time of wakeup.
I want to write a journal every day.  
- I will keep my notebook near my pillow.  
- I will write only 2 lines so it feels easy.  
- I will do it before sleeping.  
- I will smile after finishing to feel good.

**Question 9**  
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of.  
What steps can you take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, and the response unsatisfying?  
I want to stop checking my phone as soon as I wake up.  
- I will keep my phone as far as I can.  
- I will remind myself that it wastes my morning.  
- I will set a rule to avoid phone for 30 minutes after waking.  
- I will feel bad if I break this, so I will try not to.
